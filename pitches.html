<h1>Final Project Pitches</h1>

<li>Forbes does a list of Hollywood's most worthwhile and worthless movie stars every year. Like if you invest $1 in an actor, they pay back $10. I was thinking of doing this for the mid-year point for 2013. Haven't seen anything on it yet and maybe find the top 5 worst investment actors. I'd love to design it like the 'On the Bench' graphic you created. <a href="http://www.boxofficemojo.com"/>Box Office Mojo</a> has good info for this. This is my most complete idea thus far.</li>

<li>I have always wanted to get a breakdown of Manhattan by areas of the city and chart, if possible, how high rats and other pests have been noted to go. So in Financial District, find data of say they have been spotted 6 floors up, and maybe in the East Village, they go higher. Might sound like a stupid idea, just something that came to mind.</li>

<li>I'd love to breakdown the NBA finals somehow using data. I was thinking of breaking down each player and how their performance drops as they get into foul trouble. Going through the stats and looking at Duncan, Wade and Lebron to see how their points, rebounds and assists drop with 2 fouls, 3 fouls and 4. This would also be fodder for a catchy title like "Something Smells Foul"</li>
